**Research Interests**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

In my research I work on increasing the efficiency of numerical techniques
for simulating reacting flows using supercomputers. I am focused on
producing and developing methods and algorithms that help reducing the computational
cost involved in these simulations. Following this objective, I worked
on projects in different areas involving: Low-Mach-number flows,
Pressure Projection Methods, Modified Equations, Machine Learning,
Computational Fluid Dynamics, Time Integrators, Parallel Computing.
